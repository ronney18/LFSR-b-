In this assignment I learned how to use the LFSR class I made in PS2a and apply
it to encrypt each pixels of an image using a specific seed string and a tap
bit. My program works perfectly. It uses the LFSR class with a specific seed and
tap bit to encrypt each pixel colors of the image. When I re-run the program
again with the input and output image file swapped in the command line argument,
but using the same seed string and tap bit, the image gets decrypted back to how
it was in the beginning which is well implemented.

I believe that my code completely works and hope to get full points for this 
assignment.
